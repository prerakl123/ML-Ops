      "Gangadhar Agre\n",
      "Try to focus on how you extract it correctly so that you can write it OK.\n",

      "0:7:8.110 --> 0:7:26.710\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre\n",
      "OK, I won't accuracy for the every field like whichever we consider or what you can do you can finalize what are the fields available into the intensive resume format and give me the accuracy metrics because the major thing is that writing is done writing that that query is we already have this script for it but extraction and correct extraction is important.\n",
      "0:7:26.900 --> 0:7:27.270\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre\n",
      "OK.\n",

      "0:7:34.810 --> 0:7:38.780\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre\n",
      "Like what we can do so next level, we will apply the NLP there.\n",
      "0:7:38.910 --> 0:7:43.160\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre\n",
      "OK, once you're done with Regex and the keyword search, that is the rule vest.\n",
      "0:7:44.280 --> 0:7:45.620\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre\n",
      "Let's go with an LP.\n",

      "Gangadhar Agre\n",
      "Yeah.\n",

      "0:7:50.190 --> 0:7:50.390\n",
      "Sameer Panda\n",
      "This.\n",
      "0:7:49.630 --> 0:7:55.700\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre\n",
      "So this use case is the major time consuming for the format conversation.\n",
      "0:7:54.880 --> 0:7:56.940\n",
      "Sameer Panda\n",
      "Umm OK.\n",
      "0:7:55.750 --> 0:8:1.20\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre\n",
      "OK, so like suppose someone will ask you to provide me into that format document.\n",
      "0:8:1.210 --> 0:8:2.980\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre\n",
      "So yeah, you will not ready, right?\n",
      "0:8:3.40 --> 0:8:6.700\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre\n",
      "So what you do, you do the lot of manual stuff and complete it.\n",
      "0:8:6.710 --> 0:8:7.120\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "0:8:7.280 --> 0:8:13.820\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre\n",
      "But if you get a TN 75% completed automated and then you just need to do the 20%, that is the use case.\n",
      "0:8:13.830 --> 0:8:15.570\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre\n",
      "It is just not only for the resume.\n",

      "Sameer Panda\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "0:8:15.810 --> 0:8:20.660\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre\n",
      "What we will apply it for like contracts, any kind of SW signing or whatever.\n",
      "0:8:20.530 --> 0:8:20.950\n",
      "Sameer Panda\n",
      "I sort of.\n",

      "0:8:21.990 --> 0:8:24.360\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre\n",
      "OK, so so that is the use case.\n",
      "0:8:23.560 --> 0:8:27.920\n",
      "Sameer Panda\n",
      "So my multiple user one is for a Gmail, one is for the different different.\n",
      "0:8:27.790 --> 0:8:28.30\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre\n",

      "0:8:27.930 --> 0:8:30.250\n",
      "Sameer Panda\n",

      "0:8:34.130 --> 0:8:34.480\n",
      "Sameer Panda\n",
      "Understood.\n",

      "0:8:35.520 --> 0:8:38.530\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre\n",
      "And 1st technique we apply is the the regex.\n",
      "0:8:39.110 --> 0:8:39.570\n",
      "Sameer Panda\n",
      "Rejection.\n",
      "0:8:38.660 --> 0:8:39.910\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre\n",
      "That is the rule based system.\n",
      "0:8:39.580 --> 0:8:41.60\n",
      "Sameer Panda\n",
      "OK, understood.\n",

      "Gangadhar Agre\n",
      "OK, now we if we don't get accuracy for particular fields and all, then we are moving towards the NLP approach which can be like transfer or model or special NLP or NLTK or whatever we we're going to apply it.\n",
      "0:8:54.120 --> 0:8:54.360\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre\n",

      "Vivek Kadoo : They that dashboarding part and the visualization and.\n",
      "Vivek Kadoo : Thought we would have worked the more for years to come together, but yes, he has made his decision and I I would say that all the best to him for a future journey.\n",
      "Vivek Kadoo : Maybe in the future we'll cross our paths and I look forward to you.\n",

      "Gangadhar Agre : That was the major problem happened.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : So yeah, so because like the date is based on the big query and looker we're expecting.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : But but it happens, which is we did we get it or not?\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : That is like final.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : But but but things.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Yeah, like everywhere this is same, it is not like into the internship but like more majorly so someone will win, someone will not get that is happens. Yeah.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : So like to information to like the this freshers like uh Neha kanjan yeah.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : So Akash was like working with us around, I can say six month plus Akash right, yeah.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : So all the waste like from my end also like OK, and we'll start with status.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : We'll go with the rush.\n",
      "Akash Panwar : Thank you everyone.\n",
      "Dhruvesh Dilipbhai Kalathiya : Hi uh, so yesterday I worked on PPT part.\n",
      "Dhruvesh Dilipbhai Kalathiya : It is complete.\n",
      "Dhruvesh Dilipbhai Kalathiya : I'll share it with you and samyak and just.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Not directly directly share into the group.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : We'll take the input from Wake Samir.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : So we're building storyline for the data Center CPU and that the Monday I think will be sending it to the final to the the like.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Where in going to interact with client?\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : OK, so we created a final dashboard with develop Akash and build the PPT by like drawish.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Share across the team.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : We'll go through and we'll take feedback from Samir and we're also OK.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Next and you get.\n",
      "Aniket Jaware : Hi team uh.\n",
      "Aniket Jaware : So yesterday I was able to in the insert the data into the resume using the Python script where I have inserted the name, email, basic contact details.\n",
      "Aniket Jaware : After that I have inserted.\n",
      "Aniket Jaware : They may just trained objective and then educational background.\n",
      "Aniket Jaware : I only left with the project part, project and project submarine and IT skills, so we will figure out how we can extract the these skills properly from resume and insert it into the Intel Swift format resume.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : OK, so honey, get the question here is I shared you almost 8 to 9 dism, right?\n",
      "Aniket Jaware : Yeah, yeah, yes.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : And from that, if I consider there is 5 fields.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : OK, so get the accuracy metrics which tried I think yesterday now Kanchan already tried it.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : OK, she got the accuracy metrics, but it is not like above 30%.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : We're expecting minimum 75% extraction.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : OK, so don't focus writing on the intensive to template.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Try to focus on how you extract it correctly so that you can write it OK.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : So give me that accuracy metrics from your end also like for the 8 resume.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Uh, well, how many like correctly able to reextract the names?\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : How many correctly able to extract the the email ID then the other skill sent out?\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : OK, I won't accuracy for the every field like whichever we consider or what you can do you can finalize what are the fields available into the intensive resume format and give me the accuracy metrics because the major thing is that writing is done writing that that query is we already have this script for it but extraction and correct extraction is important.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : So yeah, culture and you coordinate and try to finish it today.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Like Chrissy metrics, you can share in first up, and then we'll go over.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Like what we can do so next level, we will apply the NLP there.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : OK, once you're done with Regex and the keyword search, that is the rule vest.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Let's go with an LP.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : So, Sameer, uh, so just to like FIOK.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : So this use case is the major time consuming for the format conversation.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : OK, so like suppose someone will ask you to provide me into that format document.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : So yeah, you will not ready, right?\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : So what you do, you do the lot of manual stuff and complete it.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : But if you get a TN 75% completed automated and then you just need to do the 20%, that is the use case.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : It is just not only for the resume.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : What we will apply it for like contracts, any kind of SW signing or whatever.\n",
      "Sameer Panda : I sort of.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : OK, so so that is the use case.\n",
      "Sameer Panda : So my multiple user one is for a Gmail, one is for the different different.\n",
      "Sameer Panda : So do one is for different kind of OK. OK.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Yeah, the Blue Showcase management will, we are going with the the resume proper demo, yeah.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : And 1st technique we apply is the the regex.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : That is the rule based system.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : OK, now we if we don't get accuracy for particular fields and all, then we are moving towards the NLP approach which can be like transfer or model or special NLP or NLTK or whatever we we're going to apply it.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Hopefully like if you have any input just pass it to the like Aniket and Kanchan.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Or like you can see the water existing things.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : They are also doing whenever.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : If you get the time, OK.\n",
      "Sameer Panda : Yeah, yeah, definitely.\n",
      "Sameer Panda : Definitely I'll connect towards them.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Then yeah, Aniket concern.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Clear on it or anything you want to add.\n",
      "Aniket Jaware : Is going to be very clear.\n",
      "Sameer Panda : If any questions or anything, just connect with me.\n",
      "Sameer Panda : Also, if I'm a little occupied, I'll, I'll let you know later also, but I just connect with me if you have any questions related to this and help related whatever Aniket and concern.\n",
      "Aniket Jaware : Yes, sure, sure, summit.\n",
      "Kanchan Sharma : Sure, sure, sure.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : And one note, yeah, Akash, if you have like other things related to HR and you can drop up, no need to stay in call.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Like I just told you.\n",
      "Akash Panwar : OK, no issue.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : So yeah, you can complete other formalities whatever.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : OK, because you may get some calls and OK, yeah.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Thanks man. Yeah.\n",
      "Akash Panwar : Thank you everyone.\n",
      "Akash Panwar : It was nice working with you guys.\n",
      "Kanchan Sharma : Thank you guys.\n",
      "Sameer Panda : I guess thank you.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Next we go with Ruchita.\n",
      "Ruchita Raut : So I completed the documentation part and like ready to get the further task now.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : OK, Yogesh, connect with Ruchita and explain the project, which I explained to you, OK.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : And then assign the module to her to Ruchita and Neha OK.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.\n",
      "Yogesh Rajgure : OK, Gangadhar, haven't you haven't shared the resumes with me yet, yeah.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Let it let me any Aniket please share resume across the team directly put into the group.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : OK, we already have.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : I I already have almost like 3035 resumes.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : I can just share with you guys that is no problem.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : OK, but I want to be tested on like 100 not not initially 10.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : The zoom in with accuracy metrics.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : OK, I will share Yogesh.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Yeah, that is my miss.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : I will share.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : I explained to you explain to Ruchita and Neha give them proper understanding and you are you are going to responsible for like entire that project delivery.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : OK, So what things you like face issue.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Connect with me and submit OK like higher level issues or the the the things you can coordinate with Ruthenia OK.\n",
      "Yogesh Rajgure : Something like that, yeah.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : So the like to get you Sameer, you on speed up, OK, this project where building for HR.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : OK, the same project, but the different is that let's say suppose you got to know that there is a requirement in the unified.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : So you you created the job description, but what is happening you say put it on the nokari or LinkedIn and people start emailing you like email resumes.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : OK, so in overnight you get around like 100 resume because the job job searches do like the you don't know like when how much you will get OK, but when you start in morning to find the right candidate, you will again start with the candidate which no need to reevaluate.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : OK, so sometimes you will, you will the candidate, they don't have relevant skill, you will call them.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : You will ask them and all right, so you and you see the resume by manual look.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : So we're trying to reduce that effort using this tool.\n",
      "Sameer Panda : The admins current current screening of the resume initial screening correct?\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Right, right, right.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : And and what we are going to give them like suppose based on the particular job description and the resume shared by the people, OK, we're going to give them which one is the most matching with percentage, OK that is it.\n",
      "Sameer Panda : Yeah, this is the same thing I highlighted to HR.\n",
      "Sameer Panda : I already communicated because screening is not happening properly.\n",
      "Sameer Panda : Might be it it.\n",
      "Sameer Panda : Did it come from the RMG group?\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : So that is that is seems a little later.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Me tell you scenario.\n",
      "Sameer Panda : This OK, go, go. OK.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : OK, so for data engineer I took around 30 to 35 interviews, OK and from there I got to know that only 6-7 peoples were correct on their resumes, not even the skill base.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : OK, the resume may, Josh is a hey, which is a job description for match at the back.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : You looked amazing with it, but still they came to our interview, OK?\n",
      "Sameer Panda : Yeah, the same thing I also faced and I also communicated maybe they are taught and OK, that's good only.\n",
      "Sameer Panda : Yeah, that's good.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : So yeah, so next week we are planning at least to the partial version to be released.\n",
      "Sameer Panda : Yeah, yeah, yes.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Yeah, because the module, the Aniket and Kanchan is doing that can be used here.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Yeah, but here we required, like, uh, the the more reverse skill set, the extraction and all.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : So primary focus on this, the the with the project Yogesh is doing the skillset extraction not the like name projects and all but the skill set extraction is important primary and secondary, OK.\n",
      "Sameer Panda : And another one thing.\n",
      "Sameer Panda : And do you have any shade hurried?\n",
      "Sameer Panda : Mentioned who is working what any in our teams fold is there.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Yeah, we we have, we have already the Times Planner, right.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : You have the access of it.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : You can go over it.\n",
      "Sameer Panda : Yeah, I have, actually.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Initially we are sending them the just only the Python learning OK because we wanted to like get proper ends on to them, OK and now we're moving towards the project part.\n",
      "Sameer Panda : From now understood.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : I I will share that sheet with you. OK.\n",
      "Sameer Panda : OK, sure, sure.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : You're just take this responsibility and try to like deliver like when you are like, yeah, I know you are working on project but the ruchita and has time you can like assign them properly task.\n",
      "Yogesh Rajgure : Show them better.\n",
      "Yogesh Rajgure : I will get in touch with them.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : So ruchita any question or any task do you have apart from this?\n",

      "Gangadhar Agre : OK, so you completed training also you complete the task also that is not the case.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : So going forward, they will give us how much this person can contribute to the OK.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Yeah, because that that whatever, like the anyone he came to it that is fixed, OK, because we're training you and we should get output.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : And even like you should learn something, it is not like you just complete things and yeah, like, go away.\n",
      "Ruchita Raut : Yes, yes, sure.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : So if you have any question Yogesh Connect with me on submit.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Like our so doing that thing?\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : OK, then, yeah.\n",
      "Vivek Kadoo : Yeah, I'm with that opening specification and mostly G will not be matters if we.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : OK, OK. Yeah.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : So I think the communication is not started right on it.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Did you get a chance to look into the data center that Azure created by Akash?\n",
      "Vivek Kadoo : I haven't got any link.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : I think he should do.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : We shared yesterday into the group only right.\n",
      "Dhruvesh Dilipbhai Kalathiya : Yeah, he that link is in this group only.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : OK, let let me do it.\n",
      "Vivek Kadoo : Which is the data shared by Akash right?\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Let me make it public for public access to any email.\n",
      "Dhruvesh Dilipbhai Kalathiya : Yeah, it was a.\n",

      "Dhruvesh Dilipbhai Kalathiya : OK, just one minute.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Because I want input and so we can close it today itself, we don't want to like stage it more now.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : I think hope everyone gone through it, but still we'll try to showcase what the use case was.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : So carbon footprint part I have figured it out how we can calculate it.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : I will tell you like how we need to show we want to present it.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : OK, so now the data is coming per 5 minutes or hourly wage, right?\n",

      "Gangadhar Agre : And the below graph shows that is what the correlation had and based on that we are like changing the values.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Yeah, I think we can.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Yeah, you can.\n",
      "Sameer Panda : You almost ready with with the area, I think almost reduced in some partially reduced correct if if if I see the yeah.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : You can see the PUE value with the 8 like reduce more much more.\n",
      "Sameer Panda : Dear and these are all augmented that I know.\n",
      "Sameer Panda : What you using synthesized data only correct government leader?\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Everything is augmented, but like realist, realistic solution, the same variable names, same features and everything.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : But on the. Yeah.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Yeah, yeah, it.\n",
      "Vivek Kadoo : Dang other can we also see?\n",
      "Vivek Kadoo : Like what is the past cost saving?\n",
      "Vivek Kadoo : If we if we could provide filters here, this is a live data, right?\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Yeah, this is live data.\n",
      "Vivek Kadoo : And suppose if they want to see how much I saved in past.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : That I think we can add it right, yes filter we can add it.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : So we have access to this, yeah.\n",
      "Vivek Kadoo : And it will be an another screen not on this screen because it will have some effect.\n",
      "Vivek Kadoo : So see the historical data or past data so they will understand like in month of May I save this much energy and this much cost and that was our the average PV value at the time.\n",
      "Dhruvesh Dilipbhai Kalathiya : That, yeah, that we can do some, we can do something.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Yeah, definitely. We we'll add that.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Yeah, that is a great one.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : OK, we'll add it.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : So coming to the status why Piyush?\n",
      "Piyush Jadhav : Good morning team currently means I'm learning the flask and yesterday I was getting some error in the setup and I take took the help of the Shekhar and now I have solved error.\n",
      "Piyush Jadhav : Now I'm starting with the further a learning path.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : OK, so task for Yogesh.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : And you will check what possible API you can build with their project.\n",
      "Piyush Jadhav : OK, OK. Yeah.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : So like suppose let's check example.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : The API for extracting the basic details, the API for extracting all the details.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Suppose user gives you the file and they want to see like.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : What are the suppose you have the resume right and from resume you want API or service which can extract the like name, email and ID.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : OK, so you want to you need to write EPS way and then we'll go for the flask.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Sorry, not flat streamlit application, so the UI part and the whatever like web development will be done by you for the both there. OK.\n",
      "Piyush Jadhav : I will, yeah.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : So from like upload file to the process file and then final showing the matching resume as and all.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : I will give you the clear like pictures what the screens you need to develop using streamlit so but I want you to like that should be the API based not directly the calling the methods and all.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : So Harsha and thanks for.\n",
      "Sri Harsha Vempaati : But yesterday I worked on migration documentation part, so after that I worked on Terraform for some time.\n",
      "Sri Harsha Vempaati : So after that me and Akash worked on migration to fix the fix those permission issue but still getting same issue even the the roles are enabled also it is giving issue.\n",
      "Sri Harsha Vempaati : So we thought like it is free trial account, right?\n",
      "Sri Harsha Vempaati : So that's why it is giving error.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : OK, so so.\n",
      "Sri Harsha Vempaati : So in our company we have GCP account right?\n",
      "Sri Harsha Vempaati : So if you view the thing, I will try on it once.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : OK, so before that, can you can you do one thing, do the analysis which services you are going to use and the what, maybe the cost if we need to perform it on the account.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : OK, let let's do that.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : OK, if it is coming like 5 to $6, I will provide you if it is going more than like 1020 dollars, then we will find a way how we can do it.\n",
      "Sri Harsha Vempaati : Umm, OK, I'll inform.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : So yeah, so yeah, give me the first half only, OK?\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : I can just provide the account or you you can use it account no issues but we want like the the the cost should be washed OK.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : That is the case.\n",
      "Sri Harsha Vempaati : OK, I will check and inform, yeah.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : OK, the MATLAB or experiment if you are like.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : I'm confident you can do it with like certain timeline starting with certain VM's and all you can do it OK.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : But if you think that like you need to experiment there, it may take days or no, or like some time to.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Then in that case the billing will be very high.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : So yeah, suppose 24 hours you run and $1.00 per hour for one VM.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Then it will go around $24.00 and we have this certain limits on that account like $8085 per month only.\n",
      "Sri Harsha Vempaati : OK, I will check and inform to you.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Yeah, I just go and use the Google Cloud pricing calculator, which will give the exact the the price required for your use case.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : You just mention services you want to use and all so you can find it out from the the notebook which you tried on the cloud skill boost.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Or if it is not going to work, then what we'll do?\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : We'll we'll uh get the code from the Skillbook account.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Whatever you did, and we'll try to automate it through Terra from directly.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : OK, so Tera from where I'm ask you whatever you are doing there manual like creating instance, creating the database that you can automate with Terra from with one single file you just run it and you will get all resource created.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : All services created all permissions created and everything OK, so that is the main intention behind this.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : So guys, if you are not aware like Terraform is like more famous when you need to like create certain infrastructure services permissions.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : So you just mention it and you can create it within one hour.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : So in manually how much time it will take for you like almost 2-3 hours, but in Terraform you can do in one job like 2025 minutes.\n",
      "Sri Harsha Vempaati : Hmm, you know.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : So that is the the case.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Like one approach that then we need to if you want to use the account that is fine, but you need to like before that you need to create the Terraform the script and you can run it directly and test it is working or not.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : So maybe any input this is the major issue?\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : I think we have account like limitations, OK, when we have the accounts for Azure, GCP and that that is like everywhere we go.\n",
      "Sameer Panda : So how many accounts do you have?\n",
      "Sameer Panda : Another one at your account, one GCP account for a intelliswift perspective.\n",
      "Sameer Panda : And we have some limitation.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Yeah, as long as you're with.\n",
      "Sameer Panda : OK, OK. Yeah.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Yeah, Azure with $30 GCP with I think $8085 and AWS already provided, but we haven't used it AWS now because there is like some cost issue happen OK and we will have the account for the open AI also that is like per per month to three dollars.\n",
      "Sameer Panda : OK, the judge chargeability that part, open ears OK.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Open HR deputy for developer.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : It is not the no.\n",
      "Sameer Panda : OK, I think when you optimize your cost also it's not yeah, as you mentioned if you're one BM and if you should $1.24 is running in $24.00 actually very huge cost on me.\n",
      "Sameer Panda : So again the IT will go to the management, they will ask also.\n",
      "Sameer Panda : So I think what Gangadhar mentioned, please focus that when I think who is this Harsha this one.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Yeah, that, that's what we're not sharing it for the like the experiment purpose.\n",
      "Sameer Panda : Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : But if you are confident and you say like, OK, $10 member and you can take it, no issues.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : OK, look, I hate course can show you here.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Because jacket or why important news case then account credit.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Naruto again will get stuck a firewall, but again Oberto Ghana.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : You don't know?\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Like what happens?\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : You get the questions from the management kick you use.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : There was a there is another case they don't outside news that is like big thing.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : OK, so forget about it, but.\n",
      "Sameer Panda : I I yeah, I suggest I have well herself last start analyze and just give this details to Gangadhar and post this.\n",
      "Sameer Panda : You can take the account and start working.\n",
      "Sameer Panda : Yeah, you cannot time later.\n",
      "Sameer Panda : Yeah, that's it.\n",
      "Sri Harsha Vempaati : Yeah, OK, Sir.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Yeah, the solution I'm saying is that go with Terra form Matlab Tumko Kumari infrastructure created on look at Ignite that Rodney you do it on spot or tomorrow supposed radio you can taste it quickly taken.\n",
      "Sri Harsha Vempaati : Yeah, sure. OK.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Then yeah, I think we are good.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Anyone having any question or any concern about their task?\n",

      "Vivek Kadoo : Yeah, based on something different.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : And you will also get to know the that what is new happening in company like suppose someone is giving webinar someone is like the which clients name and and so new logo got added and also kind of things they will ask there might be some historical question also come right for this week yeah that that's interesting it's like ABC you will get the 50 point that is OK but it it you have the experience OK and you will also get on that key how much things you know.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : Let let's join all together.\n",
      "Gangadhar Agre : We should we all team should like get all prices 2 for each.\n",
      "Vivek Kadoo : Even I think that they have planned for a teams also.\n",
      "Vivek Kadoo : DMA team Colombian.\n",
